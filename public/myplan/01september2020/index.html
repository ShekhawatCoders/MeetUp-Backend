				<ul>
					<li>First of all i just wanna decide what i want to do beacuse sometimes i think that if i have adopted one thing and work only on it then it could be fine, so focus on what ypu are doing, don't try be perfect in everything, like don't play with weapons.</li>
					<li>But i know that I'm very much interested in computer science and electronics and new technology, so i will go for it.</li>
					<li>Today is my 5th day of coding and i'm happy with that today i will learn segment tree and array and strings (play with indexes).</li>
					<li>Today i'm also gonna do tflite course from coursera and also tensorflow's topic like neural network and also some method, since my aim is to deploy my tensor model in android ad run that so i'm very excited that i'm gonna do machine-learning because i always want to do that, so super excited.</li>
					<li>And someone want to be taught by me, so i will try best because that's my real passion or dream or you can say my character to help others without any expectation, after all that is my final goal to make other peoples life better so i can make a better world, if someone is already doing this then he or she is my best-friend...</li>
					<li>I just wanna make people's life best not better so they can levelup themselves.</li>
					<li>if i keep writing then when i will do my work so bye i will back after mywork of segmentation tree to tell you about my experience of whole day...</li>
