			<p class="paragraph">
				We build spanning tree by adding one edge at a time.<br>
				<b>Step1</b> : First we select one vertex(any) and add it to spanning tree.<br>
				<b>Step2</b> : Now we select and add one edge which one vertex is in spanning tree and another vertex is not in spanning tree and it should have minimum weight among all combination of edges after that we include this vertex into spanning tree.<br>
				<b>Step3</b> : Repeat Step2 until all vertex is not included in spanning tree.
				<br>In the end if graph is not connected then in minimum spanning tree we have less than (n-1) edges in spanning tree.
