	<p>May be this is my mistake and that's taking me back from i can go ahead.</p>
	<p>This is my fault because i never tried to control myself.</p>
	<p>No problem but there is a big problem with me can i solve this oh man why am i asking this obviously i can.</p>
	<p>When someone ask me how to deal with people then i always aks them be polite no matter what they do, just do good to them, but now i'm thinking that i was wrong if someone is doing wrong then .. them anyone don't compromise for yourself man, we are here only for a small period and relation is not important, unknown can be your best friend, although we don't know them but they never let us get down,they never jealous of us,they never try to cheat us.</p>
	<p>Okay now i am cool.Yeap, i can solve people's problem okay now it is  fine,now whenever again it situation comes i can handle this.</p>
